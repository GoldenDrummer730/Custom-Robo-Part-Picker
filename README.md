# Custom Robo Gamecube Part Picker

The purpose of this repo is to allow users to extract a player's current robo setup to display in recordings while the game is running using Python, PyMem, PyGame, and CheatEngine. 

## How to use


## Possible Enchancement Ideas
- See if there is a way to remove CheatEngine from the equation
    - If so, then find a way to make sure that no data persists as you navigate the menu
- There has to be a place somewhere where the setup is stored rather than that one random register, so I claim there has to be a way to disassemble the game and just pull that information
- Other ways of saving out the configuration rather than using SELECT and D-PAD DOWN
